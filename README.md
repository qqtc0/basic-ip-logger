# How to use it
1. Copy the contents from `index.php`
2. Create a new file on your server, and paste the content into it.
3. Create a `log.txt` file
4. Paste a link to your website on Discord and have fun.

# Purpose
I have no idea, that's up to you to figure out. It was mainly made for Discord and shouldn't log ip's that have "discord" in their user-agent.

the basic msg: **I'm not responsible for whatever you use this for, if you decide to leak it, DDoS, etc then it's all your responsibility.**
